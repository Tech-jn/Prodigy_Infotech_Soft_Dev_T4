# Prodigy_Infotech_Soft_Dev_T4
<h3>This is a sudoku game.
This code implements a Sudoku Solver with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's tkinter library. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:</h3>

1. Main Components:
   - The code creates a 9x9 grid of entry fields representing the Sudoku board
   - A "Solve" button triggers the solving algorithm
   - Pre-filled numbers are disabled and have a gray background
   - The window has a brown background color

2. Class Structure (SudokuSolverGUI):
   - `__init__`: Initializes the GUI window and sets up initial Sudoku grid
   - `create_widgets`: Creates the 9x9 grid of entry fields and solve button
   - `solve_sudoku`: Collects values from entries and initiates solving
   - `sudoku_solver`: Implements the backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle
   - `find_empty_location`: Finds empty cells (represented by 0)
   - `is_safe`: Checks if a number can be placed in a given position

3. Solving Algorithm:
   - Uses a backtracking approach to solve the Sudoku puzzle
   - Checks rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes for valid number placement
   - If no solution exists, shows an error message

4. User Interface Features:
   - Entry fields are sized 4 characters wide
   - Uses Helvetica font, size 16
   - Pre-filled numbers are disabled and grayed out
   - Solve button has a light green background (#90EE90)
   - Numbers are center-aligned in each cell

5. Initial Grid:
   - Comes with a pre-filled example Sudoku puzzle
   - Empty cells are represented by 0 in the code
   - Users can input numbers in empty cells

To use this application:
1. Run the code
2. Input numbers in the empty cells
3. Click the "Solve" button to find the solution
4. If a solution exists, it will be displayed in the grid
5. If no solution exists, an error message will appear
